    <h1>Explaining SOC 2 to Your Board: A 5-Minute Briefing Deck Template</h1>

    <p>For many technology leaders, securing budget and buy-in for a SOC 2 audit can be a major hurdle. Your board of directors is focused on growth, revenue, and strategic risksâ€”not the nuances of security frameworks. Presenting SOC 2 in technical terms is a guaranteed way to lose their attention.</p>

    <p>The key is to frame SOC 2 as a business initiative, not a technical one. It's about enabling revenue, managing risk, and increasing company valuation. This article provides a simple, effective template for a 5-minute briefing deck designed to get your board's attention and approval.</p>

    <h2>How to Deliver the Briefing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep it short:</strong> Respect the board's time. Your goal is to deliver the core message in 5 minutes or less.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Business Outcomes:</strong> Speak their language. Connect every point back to revenue, sales, risk, or competitive positioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Use an Analogy:</strong> A simple, relatable analogy can demystify the concept instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Clear on the "Ask":</strong> State exactly what you need in terms of budget and support.</li>
    </ul>
